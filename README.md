Part A of:

 A. You need to model a shopping basket.  We must be able to:
 - add items to the shopping basket
 - remove items from the shopping basket
 - empty the shopping basket
 - calculate the total of the shopping basket

 B. For the second half of the code test we’d like you to come in, pair up with one of us and attempt the following:
 - Buy-one-get-one-free discounts on items
 - 10% off on totals greater than £20 (after bogof)
 - 2% off on total (after all other discounts) for customers with loyalty cards.
